#A bug I ran into during the creation process of this code was a misprint in the output so.
#I reorganized the print statements.
#I could make the application process more rigorous
#I could leave my email so that they can give me feedback
#to make this program better I could increase the number of conditions
#Potential bugs are misinformation given to the users
