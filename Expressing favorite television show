#The purpose of this program is to inform people of some of my favorite shows.
#The program could be useful in the real world to compare shows with my friends
#A problem I ran into was I forgot that google docs automatically uppercases letters so I had to go back and lowercase important words.
#If I were to do this program again I would find a way to display how many shows the user and I have in common and suggest shows from a different list.
