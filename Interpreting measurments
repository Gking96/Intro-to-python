#The purpose of this program was to assist Jim with his project.
#A real-world application for this would be a database that uses sizes of books to see books in which area were outdated without having to inform said area.
#i ran into several parse errors during the assignment. To fix it I often had to copy my work and refresh the page and paste.
#The next time I write a program I will make sure to pay more attention to the amount of time I am on idle.
